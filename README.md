**NOTE: while seeds and migrations have been provided for you,
you will have to make your own associations!**



# Schema and Models

Below is an outline of associations that will make this app work.

**NOTE: all of the extra info Rails needs like `:class_name` and `:source`
has been removed. You'll need to add that yourself!**

        - `has_many :songs`
        - `has_many :bookmarks`

        - `has_many :received_followings`
        - `has_many :followers`
        - `has_many :followeds`




# Auth


In order to enable Rails auth capabilities, you will need to add a migration to alter the user table.

**Once that migration is in place, don't forget to update your `seeds.rb` file to include user passwords!**


You'll have to create functionality in your `ApplicationController` and
`User` model that:
  
- make the `ApplicationController` specs pass
- use secure password encryption to store your users' passwords in the database
- allow users to login and logout




# Controllers and Views

- many of the specs test if a view is being rendered, use this along with the stories as a guide for what views to create
- many of the specs also send data to specific routes, use this to determine the expected routing structure
    - **HINT: nested routes are NOT necessary for this app**
    - **HINT: use `current_user` where ever possible to improve security and simplicity**




# Specs

Specs will tell you if your models are setup correctly.

Specs will also tell you if your controllers and routes work as expected.

**Specs do not include integration tests. You will need to manually test the forms and features of your app!**


# No Styling!

Bootstrap has been included for you in your application layout.
This is just to provide barebones styling that YOU don't have to worry about.

**DO NOT style anything or work on appearance unless you've finished all the user stories and made all specs pass!**

# Good Luck!
